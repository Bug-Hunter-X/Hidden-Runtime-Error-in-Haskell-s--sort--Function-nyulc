```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```

This code compiles and runs correctly. However, there's a subtle issue if the `numbers` list contains elements that are not comparable using the default `Ord` instance. For example, if the list contained a mix of numbers and strings, or custom data types without a defined `Ord` instance, the `sort` function would fail with a runtime error.
